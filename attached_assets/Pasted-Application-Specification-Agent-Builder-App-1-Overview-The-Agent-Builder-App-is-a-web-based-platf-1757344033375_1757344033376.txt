Application Specification: Agent Builder App
1. Overview

The Agent Builder App is a web-based platform that allows users to create, customize, and deploy AI agents. Each agent can be trained or enriched with domain-specific knowledge, integrated with external data sources, and powered by Google Vertex AI (Gemini) models for natural language understanding and reasoning.

2. Objectives

Enable users to easily build and manage AI agents without deep technical knowledge.

Provide a modular system where agents can be customized with personality, skills, and knowledge bases.

Ensure scalability and security while integrating with Vertex AI for inference and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

Support multi-channel deployment (chat widget, API, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.).

3. Key Features
3.1 Agent Management

Create, edit, and delete agents.

Assign agent name, description, avatar, and personality (tone, style, behavior).

Multi-agent support (one account can manage multiple agents).

3.2 Knowledge Management

Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT).

Import data from websites, Notion, Google Drive, or APIs.

Knowledge indexing using Vertex AI Embeddings + Vector Store.

Control scope of knowledge (per-agent, shared, private).

3.3 AI Engine

Powered by Gemini models on Vertex AI (chat, reasoning, multimodal).

Hybrid response system:

Agent personality & instructions.

Knowledge base retrieval (RAG).

Tool/action execution (e.g., API calls).

3.4 Workflow & Tools

Define actions/tools the agent can call (e.g., CRM lookup, calendar, email).

Workflow builder (if X, then agent responds with Y, or triggers an API).

Event hooks for integrations (webhooks, REST API).

3.5 Conversations

Built-in chat UI to interact with agents.

History & logs for each agent.

Admin can replay or inspect conversations.

Option to enable/disable memory (long-term vs. session memory).

3.6 Deployment

Web widget (embed code).

REST API access.

Integrations (Slack, WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, custom webhook).

3.7 Security & Access

Role-based access (Admin, User, Viewer).

Data encryption (in transit + at rest).

Audit logs for all interactions.

Configurable knowledge privacy (only certain users/orgs can access).

4. System Architecture
4.1 Frontend

Tech: React (Next.js or Vue as alternative).

Features: agent dashboard, chat UI, knowledge upload, workflow editor.

4.2 Backend

Tech: Node.js (Express/Fastify) or Go.

Handles authentication, agent lifecycle, and integrations.

Manages knowledge indexing, query routing, and conversation logs.

4.3 AI Layer

Vertex AI APIs:

Gemini Pro / Ultra → core reasoning & conversation.

Vertex AI Embeddings → vector representation of knowledge.

Vertex Matching Engine / Weaviate / Pinecone → vector store.

4.4 Database

PostgreSQL / MySQL → structured data (users, agents, configs).

Vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, or Vertex Matching Engine) → semantic search.

Redis (optional) → caching, ephemeral session memory.

4.5 Deployment

Kubernetes / Cloud Run (GCP).

CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

Logging & monitoring via GCP Cloud Logging.

5. User Roles

Admin

Manage users, agents, and system settings.

Monitor conversations.

Agent Owner

Create and customize agents.

Upload knowledge.

Deploy agents.

End User

Interact with agents via deployed channels.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

Scalability: Handle thousands of concurrent chats.

Security: GCP IAM, OAuth2 authentication.

Performance: Knowledge retrieval < 1s.

Reliability: 99.9% uptime with monitoring.

Compliance: GDPR-ready (data deletion, opt-out).

7. Future Enhancements

Agent marketplace (share/sell agents).

Fine-tuning agents on proprietary datasets.

Analytics dashboard (intent detection, success rate, engagement).

Multimodal agents (image, video, audio using Gemini multimodal).
